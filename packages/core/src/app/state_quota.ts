/**
 * app/state_quota.ts — UH-2 SS4a / task#16 (architecture §7 前置3): the byte quota
 * on a SANDBOXED App's state cell.
 *
 * ── Why ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A sandboxed App's state is the SOURCE the GenericProjectionBuilder (SS4b) renders
 * into the LLM context (方案 A declarative projection). An untrusted App that writes
 * an ever-growing or huge `state` would (a) bloat the prompt and (b) — because a
 * projection block changing every turn poisons the cache prefix — defeat the volatile
 * tier pin. The schema check (INV #14) gates SHAPE, not SIZE; this is the size gate.
 *
 * ── Scope (fail-closed, zero-regression) ───────────────────────────────────
 * The quota applies ONLY to a `trust:'sandboxed'` App, on BOTH state-write paths:
 *   - in-process `AppContext.set_state` (registry `makeContext`), and
 *   - the child-process write-back `AppRegistry.write_app_cell` (a sandboxed child
 *     framing its set_state home — the same untrusted App, different carrier).
 * A trusted App is unmetered (it is on the trusted render path already), so existing
 * built-in Apps are byte-for-byte unaffected.
 *
 * ── Behavior: REJECT, never clip ────────────────────────────────────────────
 * On over-quota we THROW (the caller leaves the cell untouched — the prior state
 * stands), rather than silently clipping. Clipping would mutate the App's own state
 * semantics behind its back (a half-written object), which is worse than a rejected
 * transition the App can observe and handle. This mirrors the schema-breach path,
 * which also rejects-and-keeps-previous (INV #14).
 *
 * Pure + O(size): one `JSON.stringify` + a byte count. No IO, no clock, no random.

 * Default ceiling for a sandboxed App's serialized state, in BYTES (UTF-8). 64 KiB:

 * fields, a short list), but far below "bloat the prompt / poison the cache". Not a
 * config knob today (a sandboxed App must not be able to widen its own limit); a host
 * may pass an override to `assertStateWithinQuota` if a future need arises.

 * Enforce the byte quota for a METERED App's next state. The gate fires when EITHER the

 * renders) OR `force` is true. `force` is the P0.4 widening (seat §10.2 GUARD2): a
 * TRUSTED App that opts into the declarative projection render path (`manifest.projection`)
 * is "metered-trusted" — its projected state reaches the prompt through the same generic
 * builder, so it must respect the same byte quota even though it is trusted. The caller
 * (registry) passes `force = manifest.projection != null` so a trusted dashboard that
 * does NOT project stays unmetered (zero regression), but one that does is capped.
 *
 * Throws `AppStateQuotaError` when `next` serializes to more than `limit` bytes so the
 * caller leaves the cell untouched. `trust` is the App's authored `manifest.trust`;
 * absent ⇒ trusted (the codebase-wide default).
